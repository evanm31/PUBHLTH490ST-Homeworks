# Biweekly Challenge 4

Created as an extra credit assignment for the Fall 2017 class while serving as an undergraduate teaching assistant. Written to help students practice the skills they've developed over the course of the semester to identify a dataset of their choice and present a story about it. The assignment is meant to be quick and complement their much more in-depth final projects, which cover a similar theme.
